# SEGP Project

Hello, this is my Software Enginerring Group Project conducted in my year 2 as a student in The University of Nottingham Malaysia

This application runs on a Docker container hosting a Kafka website, the reason Docker was used is because some of the team members were using a MacBook and we decided to have a medium that can let both Windows and Mac develop. (I understood that there were better options afterward but this is from students trying their best) 

Uses Docker, Logstash, Elastic-Search, Kafka, REST-api
